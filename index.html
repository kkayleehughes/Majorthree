            <div class="caption">1.) In 2020 when Covid hit, I moved to Orlando where I started online school with FLVS to finish out my senior year. 
                The goal was to finish my senior year in a semester instead of a year to start college early.

                Graduated highschool. Since it was online I did not have a graduation and so I did not get to celebrate graduating highschool.</div>

                still online. My dad works at Valencia so I was able to get a few free credits a semester so I took the opprotunity and worked hard.
